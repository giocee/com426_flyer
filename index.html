            <h2>Details</h2>
                <p>Students completing a thesis are required to attend the Mandatory Thesis Meeting a minimum of one time. Additional attendance is optional, but open to all candidates. However, there are no make-up meetings, as it occurs only once per semester. Therefore, first-time attendees with a date conflict or who are unable to attend should contact the Director of Academic Writing and Thesis Examiner, Dr. Patty Johnson-Winston, in advance at <a href="mailto:winston@iit.edu">winston@iit.edu</a> for special arrangements.<p>
